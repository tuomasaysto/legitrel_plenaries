# legitrel_plenaries
Script for parsing religion references from the Finnish parliament plenaries.

Parses thru plenary session documents (txt) in the data-folder. Looks for religion related keywords and associates them with political parties (using the information from the lookup folder). Creates a dataframe of the results and outputs them as excel-file.
